# Netatalk 2.2.x
A fork of the Netatalk 2.2 codebase which takes in post-2.2.6 downstream patches from various sources, while adding some modern conveniences such as [systemd unit configurations for all daemons](https://github.com/rdmark/Netatalk/tree/branch-netatalk-2-2-x/distrib/systemd).

The primary focus of this fork is to have a version of Netatalk 2.2.x that runs well on Linux on a Raspberry Pi, to serve AFP shares with classic Macs running System Software as old as 6.0.x.
